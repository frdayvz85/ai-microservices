## Features

- Generate music based on user-defined prompt.
- Store url of generated music in MongoDB.
- Retrieve url of generated music.
- Delete url of generated music.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you set up and run the music generate microservice on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following software installed on your machine:
- Python 3.7+
- MongoDB (optional)
- Cloudinary account

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/frdayvz85/openai-microservice
    cd music-generate
    ```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
    ```sh
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `env\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
   

### Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project and add following configuration variables. 

```env
REPLICATE_API_TOKEN='REPLICATE_API_TOKEN'
DATABASE_URL="DATABASE_URL"
DATABASE_NAME='DATABASE_NAME'
CLOUD_NAME="Cloudinary CLOUD_NAME"
API_KEY="Cloudinary API_KEY"
API_SECRET="Cloudinary API_SECRET"
```
The database should be MongoDB because the current implementation only supports MongoDB.

### Running the Application
To start the music generate microservice, run:
```sh
py app/main.py
```

## Dependencies
- `FastAPI`: Web framework for building APIs.
- `Pydantic`: Data validation and settings management.
