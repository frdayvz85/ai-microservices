## Getting Started

These instructions will help you set up and run the code generate microservice on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following software installed on your machine:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 14.x or higher recommended)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (usually comes with Node.js)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/frdayvz85/openai-microservice
    cd code-generate
    ```

2. Install the dependencies:
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

### Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project and add following configuration variables. 

```env
PORT=5000
OPENAI_API_TOKEN='OPENAI_API_TOKEN'
DATABASE_URL="DATABASE_URL"
API_RATE_LIMIT=5
```

The database should be MongoDB because the current implementation only supports MongoDB.

### Running the Application
To start the code generate microservice, run:
```sh
npm run start
```
The server will start on the port specified in `.env` file (default is 5000).

### Available Scripts
- `npm run start`: Runs the application.
- `npm run dev`: Runs the application in development mode with hot reloading.
- `npm run build`: Compiles TypeScript files to JavaScript.
- `npm run test`: Runs tests.
