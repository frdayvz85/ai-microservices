## Getting Started

These instructions will help you set up and run the API Gateway on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following software installed on your machine:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 14.x or higher recommended)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (usually comes with Node.js)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/frdayvz85/openai-microservice
    cd api-gateway
    ```

2. Install the dependencies:
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

### Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project and add following configuration variables. 

```env
PORT=8000
CODE_GENERATE_API_URL = 'http://localhost:5000'
VIDEO_GENERATE_API_URL = 'http://localhost:4000'
IMAGE_GENERATE_API_URL = 'http://localhost:6000'
MUSIC_GENERATE_API_URL = 'http://localhost:7000'
```

### Running the Application
To start the API Gateway, run:
```sh
npm run start
```
The server will start on the port specified in `.env` file (default is 8000).

### Available Scripts
- `npm run start`: Runs the application.
- `npm run dev`: Runs the application in development mode with hot reloading.
- `npm run build`: Compiles TypeScript files to JavaScript.


### API Documentation
The API Gateway provides endpoints for microservices. Below is an example of the endpoints and their descriptions:

- `GET /`: Testing API Gateway.
- `GET /code-generate`: Redirect request to code microservice.
- `GET /music-generate`: Redirect request to music microservice.
- `GET /image-generate`: Redirect request to image microservice.
- `GET /video-generate`: Redirect request to video microservice.

Refer to the source code for more details on available endpoints and their usage.

Happy Coding! ðŸš€
